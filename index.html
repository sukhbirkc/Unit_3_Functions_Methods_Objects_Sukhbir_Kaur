   <p>1) When you ask the function to perform its task, it is known as calling the function. When you are calling a function you are telling the computer to run the tasks.</p>
  <p>2) Parameters are information or values given to the function. For example if you want the function to calculate the area of a rectangle it would need to be given some information to find the value and in this case the information we need to give is the width and hight.</p>
   <p>3) Programming languages rely on the name/value pairs. The function has a name, updateMessage, and the value is the code block When you call the function by its name then the statements will run.</p>
  <p>4) The difference between a parameter and arguments is that parameter is when a function needs information for it to work and parameters act like variables and is listend inside the parentheses. An argument is actual values that are sent to the function when it is being called.</p>
